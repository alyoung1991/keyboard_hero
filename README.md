# keyboard_hero

Background

A Guitar Hero inspired game which allows the user to use their computer's keyboard as a musical keyboard. The application will have a game mode in which users can play a song at its original tempo, 
The application will keep track of the user's score dependent on whether the user plays the correct node at the correct time.  

Visually, the application will have two main sections: a “song visualization” section, and a “keyboard” section. The “song visualization” section will display a scrolling panel which shows 
the user which notes are coming up in the song. The “keyboard” section will have a visualization of a real musical keyboard, displaying the corresponding computer key characters on each piano key.
The application will rely mainly on the Javascript Web Audio API for handling musical notes, as well as event handlers (vanillaJS or jQuery) to listen for user keypress input.
